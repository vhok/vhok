## I'm a Web Developer, Fitness Enthusiast, and Foodie :hamburger:!

My background was in Engineering where I worked in the aerospace industry. Despite enjoying my role, I spent years considering whether there was something more I wanted to do. 2020 was a crazy one... But, because of it, I finally received the push I needed to make my move into Web Development. From aerospace :airplane: to the internet :computer: I'm excited to finally be here. Everyday I wake up refreshed knowing that I'm surrounded by an incredible community of like-minded collaborators!

- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning React context API, Node.js, and MongoDB.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other Web Developers.
- ðŸ¥… 2021 Goals: Make it the best year to date.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to snowboarding, anime, and gaming.
