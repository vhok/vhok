## I'm a Web Developer, Fitness Enthusiast, and Foodie :hamburger:!

My background was in Engineering where I worked in the aerospace industry. Despite enjoying my role, I spent years considering whether there was something more I wanted to do. 2020 was a crazy one... But, because of it, I finally received the push I needed to make my move into Web Development. I'm excited to finally be here and knowing that I'm surrounded by an incredible community of like-minded collaborators!

- üìö I‚Äôm currently learning React Context API, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate with other Web Developers.
- üèí 2021 Goals: Make it the best year to date.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I love snowboarding, anime, and gaming.
